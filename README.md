# Hello World

This project implements **Hello World** in C and Assembly without the standard library or any other external dependencies. This project is written for macOS and Apple silicon and contains both ARM64 assembly and manual system calls. Although this project has no explicit dependencies, it is still linked with the standard library due to an implicit dependency on `libSystem.dylib`.
