# Hello World

This project implements **Hello World** in C and Assembly without the standard library or any other external dependencies, written for macOS and Apple silicon. It contains both ARM64 assembly and manual system calls. Although this project has no explicit dependencies, it's still linked with the standard library as it's implicitly dependent on `libSystem.dylib`.
